Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.
Ans--> A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and organized in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of that data. Databases are used to store and manage large amounts of information, ranging from personal contact lists to complex business data.

SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases:

1.SQL Databases: SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases, which means that they store data in tables and use a schema to define the relationships between those tables. SQL databases are based on a set of standards and conventions that ensure consistency and reliability. SQL databases are well-suited for applications that require complex querying and transactions, such as financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and inventory management systems.

2.NoSQL Databases: NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in a more flexible and scalable way. NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, such as key-value, document, column-family, and graph databases, to store and retrieve data. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media content, sensor data, and log files. NoSQL databases can be highly scalable and fault-tolerant, but they may not be as consistent as SQL databases and may require more expertise to manage.

In summary, SQL databases are well-suited for applications that require complex querying and transactions, while NoSQL databases are better for applications that need to handle large amounts of unstructured data and require more scalability and flexibility.

Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.
Ans--> DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL used to define and manipulate the structure of a database, including creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, and views. DDL commands are used to define the schema of the database and are not used to manipulate the data stored in the database.

Here are some common DDL commands and their uses:

1.CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create a new database object, such as a table, index, or view. For example, the following SQL statement creates a new table called "customers" with four columns: "id", "name", "email", and "phone".

CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(50),
    phone VARCHAR(20)
);

2.DROP: The DROP command is used to delete an existing database object, such as a table, index, or view. For example, the following SQL statement deletes the "customers" table that we created in the previous example:

DROP TABLE customers;

3.ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify an existing database object, such as a table, index, or view. For example, the following SQL statement adds a new column called "address" to the "customers" table:

ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN address VARCHAR(100);

4.TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the data in a table, but not the table itself. This command is faster than the DELETE command, which removes data row by row. For example, the following SQL statement removes all the data from the "customers" table:

TRUNCATE TABLE customers;

In summary, DDL commands such as CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used to define and manipulate the structure of a database, including creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, and views. These commands are essential for managing the schema of a database and ensuring that it reflects the requirements of the application using it.

Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.
Ans--> DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, which is a subset of SQL used to insert, update, and delete data in a database. DML commands are used to manipulate the data stored in the database and are not used to modify the structure of the database.

Here are some common DML commands and their uses:

1.INSERT: The INSERT command is used to add new data to a table. For example, the following SQL statement inserts a new row into the "customers" table:

INSERT INTO customers (id, name, email, phone) VALUES (1, 'John Smith', 'john@example.com', '555-1234');

2.UPDATE: The UPDATE command is used to modify existing data in a table. For example, the following SQL statement updates the email address of the customer with the ID of 1 in the "customers" table:

UPDATE customers SET email = 'johnsmith@example.com' WHERE id = 1;

3.DELETE: The DELETE command is used to remove data from a table. For example, the following SQL statement deletes the customer with the ID of 1 from the "customers" table:

DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 1;

In summary, DML commands such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are used to manipulate the data stored in a database. These commands are essential for managing the content of a database and ensuring that it reflects the current state of the application using it.

Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.
Ans--> DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a subset of SQL used to retrieve data from a database. DQL commands are used to query the data stored in the database and are not used to modify the structure of the database or the data stored in it.

The most common DQL command is SELECT, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. Here is an example of a SELECT statement:

SELECT * FROM customers;

This SQL statement retrieves all the rows and columns from the "customers" table. The "*" symbol is a wildcard that selects all the columns in the table. We could also specify the columns we want to retrieve by listing them after the SELECT keyword, separated by commas:

SELECT id, name, email FROM customers;

This SQL statement retrieves only the "id", "name", and "email" columns from the "customers" table.

We can also use the WHERE clause to filter the data retrieved by a SELECT statement. For example, the following SQL statement retrieves all the rows from the "customers" table where the "name" column is equal to "John Smith":

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name = 'John Smith';

This SQL statement returns only the rows that match the specified condition, which in this case is the name "John Smith".

In addition to the WHERE clause, there are many other keywords and clauses that can be used with the SELECT statement to customize the data retrieved from a database, such as GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and JOIN. These features allow for complex queries that can extract insights and trends from large amounts of data.

In summary, SELECT is a DQL command used to retrieve data from a database. This command is essential for reading data from a database and can be customized with a variety of keywords and clauses to extract the desired information.

Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.
Ans--> In a relational database, a primary key and a foreign key are two important concepts that are used to define the relationships between tables.

A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table. It is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identify a row in a table. The primary key is used to enforce the integrity of the data by ensuring that each row in a table can be uniquely identified. Primary keys are essential for maintaining the consistency and correctness of the data in a database.

A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables. It is used to ensure referential integrity, which means that the data in the related tables is consistent and correct. A foreign key is used to enforce the rule that a row in one table cannot be deleted if it has related rows in another table.

Here's an example of how primary keys and foreign keys work in a simple database design. Consider a database with two tables: "Customers" and "Orders". The "Customers" table has a primary key of "CustomerID", which uniquely identifies each customer. The "Orders" table has a foreign key of "CustomerID", which refers to the primary key in the "Customers" table.

Here's how the relationship between the two tables would be expressed in SQL:

CREATE TABLE Customers (
  CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(50),
  Email VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
  OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  CustomerID INT,
  OrderDate DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);

In this example, the "Customers" table has a primary key of "CustomerID", which is a unique identifier for each row in the table. The "Orders" table has a foreign key of "CustomerID", which refers to the primary key in the "Customers" table. This ensures that each order in the "Orders" table is associated with a unique customer in the "Customers" table.

In summary, a primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table, while a foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. These keys are used to establish relationships between tables and ensure the integrity and consistency of the data in a database.

Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.
Ans--> To connect MySQL to Python, we need to use a database connector. The most common connector for MySQL is the mysql-connector-python library. Here's an example of how to connect to a MySQL database using this library in Python:

import mysql.connector

# connect to MySQL database
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="username",
  password="password",
  database="databasename"
)

# create cursor object
mycursor = mydb.cursor()

# execute SQL query
mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM tablename")

# fetch the result
result = mycursor.fetchall()

# print the result
for row in result:
  print(row)

In this code, we first import the mysql.connector library and use the connect() method to establish a connection to a MySQL database. We provide the host, username, password, and database name as parameters to the connect() method.

We then create a cursor object using the cursor() method. The cursor is used to execute SQL queries and fetch results. The cursor() method creates a cursor object, which is a pointer to the current row in the result set.

The execute() method is used to execute SQL queries. We pass the SQL query as a parameter to the execute() method. In this example, we execute a SELECT query to retrieve all the rows from a table.

The fetchall() method is used to fetch all the rows returned by the SELECT query. We store the result in a variable called "result".

Finally, we use a for loop to iterate over the result set and print each row.

In summary, the cursor() method creates a cursor object, which is used to execute SQL queries and fetch results, while the execute() method is used to execute SQL queries. Together, these methods enable us to connect to a MySQL database and retrieve data using Python.

Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.
Ans--> In an SQL query, the order of execution of SQL clauses is as follows:

1.FROM clause: Specifies the tables from which the data is to be retrieved.
2.JOIN clause: Joins two or more tables based on a specified condition.
3.WHERE clause: Filters the data based on a specified condition.
4.GROUP BY clause: Groups the data based on a specified column.
5.HAVING clause: Filters the grouped data based on a specified condition.
6.SELECT clause: Specifies the columns to be retrieved from the tables.
7.DISTINCT clause: Removes duplicate rows from the result set.
8.ORDER BY clause: Sorts the result set based on a specified column or columns.
9.LIMIT clause: Limits the number of rows returned by the query.

It's important to note that not all clauses are required in a query, and some clauses can be omitted depending on the specific requirements of the query. However, in general, the above order of execution should be followed to ensure that the query is executed correctly and efficiently.
